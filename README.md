## Getting Started

### 1️ Prerequisites
- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- A running database instance (We preffer PostgreSQL)
- Git

### 2️ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/supunsarachitha/SmartShop-API.git
cd SmartShop-API
```

### 3️ Configure Environment
Create an `appsettings.json` file in `SmartShop.API/` with your database connection string:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings":
  {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=SmartShop;User Id=youruser;Password=yourpassword;"
  },
  "Jwt":
  {
    "Key": "your-256-bit-secret-key-should-be-at-least-32-characters-long",
    "Issuer": "SmartShopIssuer",
    "Audience": "SmartShopAudience"
  }
}
```

### Initial Database Setup and Seeding

When you run the project for the first time, the database will be seeded with initial data for user roles and an admin user. This is handled in `SmartShopDbContext.OnModelCreating`.
You can change the default admin username and password in `SmartShopDbContext.cs` before running migrations.

**Sample demo seeded Data:**
- Two roles: `SysAdmin` and `StoreAdmin`
- One admin user:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Email: `admin@smartshop.local`
  - Password: `admin123` (hashed in the database)

**How to apply the seed:**
1. Ensure your connection string is set up in `appsettings.json`.
2. Run the following command to create and apply migrations:
```
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```
3. The database will be created and seeded automatically.
 

### Build and Run Locally

```sh
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run --project SmartShop.API/SmartShop.API.csproj
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5218` by default.

---

#### Run Locally with Docker

```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 stechbuzz/smartshop-api:latest
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.


## API Documentation

Once running, you can explore the API via Swagger UI:

## Testing

Run unit tests with:
```bash
dotnet test
```
This solution includes unit and integration test projects to ensure SmartShop-API’s reliability. These test projects help maintain high code quality and a stable API.

**Unit tests** check individual components in isolation, using mocks to simulate dependencies and provide quick feedback during development.

**Integration tests** verify that different modules and services work together correctly, catching issues that unit tests may miss.
