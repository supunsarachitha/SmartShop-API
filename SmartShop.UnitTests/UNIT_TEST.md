# Unit Tests Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the unit tests located in the `SmartShop.UnitTests` folder of the `SmartShop-API` repository. Unit tests are essential to ensure the correctness, reliability, and maintainability of the codebase. This guide explains the purpose of these tests, their organization, and instructions for running and extending them.

## Folder Structure

```
SmartShop.UnitTests/
├── [TestClass1].cs
├── [TestClass2].cs
├── ...
```

Each file in this folder typically contains test classes that correspond to different components or modules of the SmartShop API.

## Purpose of the Unit Tests

- **Validation:** Ensure that individual functions and classes behave as expected.
- **Regression Prevention:** Catch bugs early when code changes are made.
- **Documentation:** Serve as executable examples of how the code should be used.

## Common Test Components

- **Test Classes:** Group related tests together, usually for a specific class or module.
- **Test Methods:** Individual tests for functions or behaviors. Methods often have descriptive names indicating what is being tested.
- **Setup and Teardown:** Methods marked with `[TestInitialize]` and `[TestCleanup]` for preparing and cleaning up test contexts.

## How to Run Tests

1. **Using Visual Studio:**
   - Open the solution in Visual Studio.
   - Build the solution.
   - Go to Test Explorer (`Test > Test Explorer`).
   - Run all tests or individual tests.
2. **Using Command Line (dotnet CLI):**
   - Navigate to the solution directory.
   - Run:  
     ```
     dotnet test SmartShop.UnitTests
     ```

## Adding New Tests

1. Create a new test class for the component you want to test.
2. Decorate the class with `[TestClass]`.
3. Write test methods and decorate them with `[TestMethod]`.
4. Use assertions (`Assert.AreEqual`, `Assert.IsTrue`, etc.) to verify expected outcomes.

## Best Practices

- **Isolate Tests:** Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests.
- **Clear Naming:** Test methods should clearly state what they verify.
- **Arrange-Act-Assert:** Structure tests in three sections:
  - Arrange: Prepare test objects and set up prerequisites.
  - Act: Execute the method being tested.
  - Assert: Check that the results are as expected.

## Example Test Class

```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

namespace SmartShop.UnitTests
{
    [TestClass]
    public class ProductServiceTests
    {
        [TestMethod]
        public void GetProduct_ReturnsProduct_WhenIdIsValid()
        {
            // Arrange
            var service = new ProductService();
            int validId = 1;

            // Act
            var result = service.GetProduct(validId);

            // Assert
            Assert.IsNotNull(result);
            Assert.AreEqual(validId, result.Id);
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are referenced and restored.
- If tests fail, check error messages and stack traces for clues.
- Clean and rebuild the solution if tests aren’t detected.

## Contributing

- Follow existing patterns and naming conventions.
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Review and update tests when changing code.
